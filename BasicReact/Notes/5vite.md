# Is Vite a Framework?

Many of the developers are in a dilemma to consider Vite as a framework or tool. So, let me clear the fog that Vite is a frontend dev tool, which supports any frontend framework, with supported templates for Vue, TezJS, React, Preact, Lit Element, Svelte, and vanilla JavaScript. However, Vite is not only Vue-specific.

In a nutshell, Vite is simply a build tool and dev environment that any developer can leverage.
