# Points to Remember :

1. Whenever returning markup language, it should always return 1 root element which means , it should be wrapped inside a container(<></> this is called fragments).
So, we can't make two div inside one root(return) instead wecan make mmore div inside the fragment(<></>) .

2. All the tags should be closing (for eg : <img src='link'/>, this / is used to close the tag in react).
